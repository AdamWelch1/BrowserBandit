#BrowserBandit

BrowserBandit searches a browser profile folder (firefox, chrome, etc) and reports on the information found, including user/pass combos, history, cookies, etc.

**Currently, this project is very new and lacking pretty much all functionality. I intend to have it working in Firefox and Google Chrome first, and possibly add support for other browsers later on.**
